### Andromeda XIX
Notes: 
Note this galaxy is likely affected by tidal processes interacting with the nearby M31 \citep{Collins2020}. 
$a$ = Surface brightness calculated using the properties listed in Table 3 of \citet{Collins2020} and equation 12 of \citet{Graham2005}. Due to the extremely diffuse nature of this object this value is highly uncertain. 
Data sources: \citet{Martin2016, Collins2020, Gannon2021}.

### Antlia II
Notes: 
Dynamical modelling suggests that a combination of a cored dark matter profile and tidal stripping may explain the properties of this UDG \citep{torrealba2019}.
$a$ = Vega magnitude. 
$b$ = Due to the extremely faint nature of Antlia II the surface brightness is highly uncertain. 
Data sources: \citet{mcconnachie2012, torrealba2019}

### NGC 1052 - DF2
Notes:
This galaxy has both an anomalous star cluster system \citep{vanDokkum2018b, Shen2021} and an abnormally low velocity dispersion \citep{vanDokkum2018, Danieli2019}. There is also evidence it may be undergoing a tidal interaction (\citealp{ Keim2021}, although see \citealp{Montes2021}). We do however note there is some evidence for rotation in NGC 1052-DF2 which may help alleviate the paucity of dark matter implied by its low velocity dispersion \citep{Lewis2020, Montes2021}. 
$a$ = While there existed some initial controversy over the distance of NGC 1052-DF2 (see e.g., \citealp{Trujillo2019, Monelli2019}) we believe the deeper data reported in \citet{Shen2021} resolved this issue. We note however, despite an established distance this does not fully establish an environmental association for NGC 1052-DF2 (see e.g., Fig. 5 of \citealp{Shen2021}). The possibility exists that NGC 1052-DF2 was part of the NGC~1052 group but now resides outside of the group as a consequence of its formation (e.g., \citealp{vanDokkum2022}).
$b$ = Surface brightness calculated using the properties listed for the single S\'ersic fit in Table 2 of \citet{Cohen2018} and equation 11 of \citet{Graham2005}. 
$c$ = We preference the recessional velocity and velocity dispersion values reported by \citet{Danieli2019} over those reported in \citet{Emsellem2019} due to the greater instrumental resolution of Keck/KCWI over VLT/MUSE.
$d$ = For the GC counts we use the value of GCs in the roughly expected GC luminosity function window as reported by \citet{Shen2021}. This value excludes the brighter sub-population. 
$e$ = Note that this galaxy has had its stellar populations studied by both \citet{RuizLara2019} and also by \citet{Fensch2019}. Here we use the \citet{Fensch2019} values due to the higher FOV of MUSE over OSIRIS being expected to capture a more global value. Both values are in reasonable agreement. 
Data sources: \citet{Fensch2019, Danieli2019, Shen2021}.

$c$ = We preference the distance/GC richness from \citet{Danieli2022} over those reported in \citet{Muller2021} due to the deeper \textit{HST} data used.
