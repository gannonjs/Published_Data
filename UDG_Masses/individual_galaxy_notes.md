### Y358
Notes: 
$a$ = Calculated from the absolute magnitude assuming $M_{\star} / L_{V} =2$ and $M_{\odot, V}$ = 4.8 \citep{Wilmer2018}.  
$b$ = Circularised using literature $b/a$ (0.83; \citealp{vanDokkum2017}). 
Data sources: This work, \citet{vanDokkum2017} and \citet{Lim2018}.  

### VCC 1287
Notes: 
$a$ = This galaxy is identified as NGVSUDG-14 in \citet{Lim2020}. 
$b$ = It is unclear which filter band this is in, although $g$-band seems likely from the context. We therefore transform it into $V$-band using $V$ = $g - 0.3$. 
Data sources: \citet{Beasley2016, Gannon2020, Gannon2021, Lim2020}. 

### DGSAT I
Notes:
$a$ = It is located in the Pisces--Perseus supercluster and could potentially be a 'backsplash' galaxy \citep{MartinezDelgado2016, Papastergis2017}. 
$b$ = Calculated using the properties listed in Table 2 of \citet{MartinezDelgado2016} and equation 11 of \citet{Graham2005}. 
$c$ = Circularised using literature $b/a$. $d$ = Note that some of these GC's may be overluminous \citep{Janssens2022}. 
Data sources: \citet{MartinezDelgado2016, MartinNavarro2019, Janssens2022}. 

### Dragonfly 44
Notes:
$a$ = Although in the direction of the Coma cluster it is unclear whether Dragonfly 44 is in a cold clump that is falling into the cluster, a filament, or a structure that is unrelated to Coma'' \citep{vanDokkum2019b}. 
$b$ = Calculated using the properties listed in Table 1 of \citet{vanDokkum2017} at a distance of 100 Mpc and equation 11 of \citet{Graham2005}. 
$c$ = Converted using $V_{\rm R} = c \times \ln{1+z}$ from the redshift listed in footnote 6 of \citet{vanDokkum2017}. 
$d$ = Note the $N_{\rm GC}$ quoted in the abstract is slightly different to this value. Here we use the value from Table 1 of \citet{vanDokkum2017}. 
$e$ = Although see \citet{Saifollahi2021} for a differing view of the GC richness of Dragonfly~44. 
Data sources: \citet{vanDokkum2016, vanDokkum2017, vanDokkum2019b, Gannon2021}.

### DFX1
Notes: 
$a$ = Calculated using the properties listed in Table 1 of \citet{vanDokkum2017} at a distance of 100 Mpc and equation 11 of \citet{Graham2005}. 
$b$ = Converted using $V_{\rm R} = c \times \ln{1+z}$ from the redshift listed in section 2.1 of \citet{vanDokkum2017}. 
$c$ = it is unclear if this is also effected by the barycentric correction issue described in footnote 16 of \citet{vanDokkum2019b}. 
Data sources: \citet{vanDokkum2017, Gannon2021}. 

### NGC 5846 UDG1

$b$ = Calculated using the properties listed in Table 1 of \citet{Forbes2019} and equation 11 of \citet{Graham2005}. Transformed from $g$-band using $V = g-0.3$. 
$c$ = We preference these values over those reported in \citet{Muller2020} due to the greater instrumental resolution of Keck/KCWI over VLT/MUSE. 
$d$ = We preference these values over those reported in \citet{Muller2021} due to the deeper \textit{HST} data used. 
Data sources: \citet{Muller2020, Muller2021, Forbes2021, Danieli2022}.

### VLSB-D

### UDG1137+16
Notes: 
UDG1137+16 has a disturbed morphology making it likely it is undergoing stripping \citep{Gannon2021}.

### NGC 1052 - DF2
Notes:
This galaxy has both an anomalous star cluster system \citep{vanDokkum2018b, Shen2021} and an abnormally low velocity dispersion \citep{vanDokkum2018, Danieli2019}. There is also evidence it may be undergoing a tidal interaction (\citealp{ Keim2021}, although see \citealp{Montes2021}). We do however note there is some evidence for rotation in NGC 1052-DF2 which may help alleviate the paucity of dark matter implied by its low velocity dispersion \citep{Lewis2020, Montes2021}. 
$a$ = This is also catalogued as [KKS2000]04 in \citet{Karachentsev2000}. 
$b$ = While there existed some initial controversy over the distance of NGC 1052-DF2 (see e.g., \citealp{Trujillo2019, Monelli2019}) we believe the deeper data reported in \citet{Shen2021} resolved this issue. We note however, despite an established distance this does not fully establish an environmental association for NGC 1052-DF2 (see e.g., Fig. 5 of \citealp{Shen2021}). The possibility exists that NGC 1052-DF2 was part of the NGC~1052 group but now resides outside of the group as a consequence of its formation (e.g., \citealp{vanDokkum2022}).
$c$ = Calculated using the properties listed for the single S\'ersic fit in Table 2 of \citet{Cohen2018} and equation 11 of \citet{Graham2005}. 
$d$ = We preference these values over those reported in \citet{Emsellem2019} due to the greater instrumental resolution of Keck/KCWI over VLT/MUSE.
$e$ = Here we use the value of GCs in the roughly expected GC luminosity function window as reported by \citet{Shen2021}. This value excludes the brighter sub-population. 
Data sources: \citet{Danieli2019, Shen2021}.

### Saggitarius dSph
Notes: 
Note this galaxy is known to be tidally disrupting around the Milky Way \citep{Ibata2001}
$a$ Calculated using the properties listed in Table 1 of \citet{forbes2018} and equation 12 of \citet{Graham2005}. 
Data sources: \citet{mcconnachie2012, Karachentsev2017, forbes2018}.

### Andromeda XIX
Notes: 
Note this galaxy is likely affected by tidal processes interacting with the nearby M31 \citep{Collins2020}. 
$a$ = Calculated using the properties listed in Table 3 of \citet{Collins2020} and equation 12 of \citet{Graham2005}. Due to the extremely diffuse nature of this object this value is highly uncertain. 
Data sources: \citet{Martin2016, Collins2020, Gannon2021}.

### Antlia II
Notes: 
Dynamical modelling suggests that a combination of a cored dark matter profile and tidal stripping may explain the properties of this UDG \citep{torrealba2019}.
$a$ = Vega magnitude. 
$b$ Due to the extremely faint nature of Antlia II this value is highly uncertain. 
Data sources: \citet{mcconnachie2012, torrealba2019}
