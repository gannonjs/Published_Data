This folder is designed to store a public database of UDG dynamical masses. It represents an extension of Table A1 from:

Gannon J.~S., Forbes D.~A., Brodie J.~P., Romanowsky A.~J., Couch W.~J., Ferr{\'e}-Mateu A., 2023, MNRAS, 518, 3653. doi:10.1093/mnras/stac3264

It is requested users of this database please cite the above work.

To be included in the table galaxies are required to have:
1) A half-light radius > 1.5 kpc (note this is semi-major while the table lists circularised).
2) An average V-band surface brightness < \mu_V > greater than 25 mag/ arcsec^2.
3) A spectroscopic velocity dispersion. 

Cuts 1) and 2) are designed based on the van Dokkum (2015) UDG definition but here we choose an average surface brightness cut to not bias ourselves against nucleated UDGs.

For those interested in seeing a version history of changes please consult the git comments.

If you have any questions with the data, wish to have me include your galaxy in the database, or would like to disagree with me about my choices made please contact me via email:
