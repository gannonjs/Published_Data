This folder is designed to store a public database of UDG dynamical masses. It represents an extension of Table A1 from:

Gannon J.~S., Forbes D.~A., Brodie J.~P., Romanowsky A.~J., Couch W.~J., Ferr{\'e}-Mateu A., 2023, MNRAS, 518, 3653. doi:10.1093/mnras/stac3264

It is requested users of this database please cite the above work.

It contains:
1) This Readme
2) bibiography.txt - A bibliography of bibtex entries for the source material
3) column_labels.txt - A list of the columns and their units
4) udg_data.csv - a csv file containing the UDG database. The first row re-lists the columns.


To be included in the database galaxies are required to have:
1) A half-light radius > 1.5 kpc (note this is semi-major while the table lists circularised).
2) An average V-band surface brightness < \mu_V >)_e within the half-light radius greater than 24.7 mag/ arcsec^2.
3) A spectroscopic velocity dispersion. 

Cuts 1) and 2) are designed based on the van Dokkum et al. (2015) UDG definition but here we choose an average surface brightness cut to not bias ourselves against nucleated UDGs.

To the best of my knowledge I have included all galaxies published in the literature that meet these criteria. I do not pretend to be omniscient however so if I've missed your work (sorry) please contact me via the email below to fix this.

For those interested in seeing a version history of changes please consult the git comments.

If you have any questions with the data, wish to have me include your galaxy in the database, or would like to disagree with me about my choices made please contact me via email:
